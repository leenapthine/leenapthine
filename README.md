<br>

**Hello, I'm Lee**, a third-year computer science student at the University of Victoria. My interests lie at the intersection of [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/50gZGkC4xYd5vJUBEnXwXP), data analysis, and game development. I'm passionate about learning, building projects, and I'm always eager for new opportunities.
